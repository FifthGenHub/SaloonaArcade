      <p>By accessing or playing DexHunt or any other game within the Saloona Arcade platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, our <a href="./privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="./disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a>, and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree, you must not use the platform.</p>
      <p>You also agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration and waive any right to participate in class actions or jury trials, where permitted by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction) and capable of forming a legally binding contract to access, play, or transact on the Saloona Arcade platform.</p>
      <p>Participation is void where prohibited by law, including in restricted jurisdictions (see Section 9).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Beta Testing</h2>
      <p>DexHunt is currently in beta testing on Solana Devnet. All transactions, rewards, and tokens ($SALOONA) are simulated and have no real-world value. Participation is for testing and feedback purposes only.</p>
      <p>Saloona Arcade reserves the right to modify or terminate the beta at any time without notice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Crypto and Token Use</h2>
      <p>$SALOONA is a utility token used for gameplay and in-game rewards within DexHunt. It is <strong>not an investment vehicle</strong>, security, digital currency, or financial instrument. $SALOONA provides no ownership stake, equity, or financial return.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge that $SALOONA has no guaranteed value, resale potential, or appreciation. Any use of $SALOONA outside the platform (e.g., via Jupiter swaps) is at your own risk, subject to Solana network conditions and applicable fees.</p>
      <p>During beta testing, $SALOONA exists solely on Solana Devnet and has no monetary value.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. NFTs and Gameplay Winnings</h2>
      <p>NFTs, such as the “Lightning Draw” or “Phantom Rider,” are digital collectibles awarded based on skill-based gameplay performance. Ownership does not confer legal rights, royalties, dividends, or intellectual property ownership.</p>
      <p>NFTs have in-game utility only and are not investments. Any resale or use on third-party marketplaces is at your discretion and risk, and we do not guarantee future value or marketability.</p>
      <p>During beta testing, NFTs are simulated and have no real-world value or transferability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. NFT License Terms</h2>
      <p>All NFTs earned or purchased on Saloona Arcade are subject to the following license terms:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> You own the NFT as a digital collectible, but not the underlying artwork or intellectual property, which remains with Saloona Arcade.</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial Use:</strong> You may <strong>not</strong> commercialize NFT artwork (e.g., create merchandise) without written permission from Saloona Arcade.</li>
        <li><strong>Lockup Period:</strong> NFTs earned via gameplay cannot be traded or transferred for <strong>30 days</strong> after acquisition, even post-beta.</li>
        <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> We reserve the right to disable in-game utility for NFTs obtained fraudulently or in violation of these Terms.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>By claiming an NFT, you agree to these terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Skill-Based Gameplay</h2>
      <p>DexHunt is a skill-based reflex game, not a game of chance or gambling. Rewards are earned based on player performance (e.g., reaction time). You acknowledge that outcomes depend on your skill, and no guarantees of rewards are made.</p>
      <p>Features like “Double or Nothing” are skill-based challenges and do not involve real-world financial risk during beta testing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Wallet and Blockchain Risks</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for securing your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom Wallet) and private keys. Saloona Arcade is not liable for losses due to wallet errors, hacks, or unauthorized access.</p>
      <p>Blockchain transactions, including $SALOONA swaps via Jupiter, may incur network fees or risks (e.g., smart contract failures, network congestion). You assume all such risks.</p>
      <p>During beta testing, all wallet interactions occur on Solana Devnet and are simulated.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Saloona Arcade, its affiliates, and partners are not liable for any losses, damages, or claims arising from gameplay, wallet errors, network issues, token/NFT value fluctuations, or technical failures.</p>
      <p>The platform is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. Use at your own risk.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Fair Play and Anti-Cheat</h2>
