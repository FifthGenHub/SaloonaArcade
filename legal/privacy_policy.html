    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <a href="../duel.html" class="back-link">Back to DexHunt</a>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Saloona Arcade</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect data related to your use of DexHunt and the Saloona Arcade platform, a Web3 gaming service on Solana. By using the platform, you consent to this policy.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect minimal data to enable gameplay, reward distribution, and platform functionality. During beta testing on Solana Devnet, all data is processed for testing purposes and has no real-world implications.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Wallet Addresses:</strong> When you connect a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom Wallet), we collect your public wallet address to facilitate gameplay, track simulated rewards ($SALOONA, NFTs), and enable swaps via Jupiter.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Metrics:</strong> We store data such as score history, reaction times, win/loss records, and NFT ownership to support leaderboards, competitions, and reward verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use browser-based local storage to maintain session state, display features like jackpot status, and enhance user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics (Optional):</strong> We may use anonymized analytics to improve gameplay, such as tracking game performance or user interactions, with your consent where required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No personally identifiable information (e.g., names, emails, addresses) is collected. All data is processed under the legal basis of user consent and our legitimate interest in operating a secure, skill-based gaming platform.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use this data to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable core gameplay functionality, including wallet-restricted rewards and skill-based challenges (e.g., “Double or Nothing”).</li>
        <li>Display leaderboards, best draw times, and jackpot status.</li>
        <li>Verify and distribute simulated rewards, such as $SALOONA tokens and NFTs, during beta testing.</li>
        <li>Prevent fraudulent gameplay, botting, or exploitation through security monitoring.</li>
        <li>Improve the platform by analyzing anonymized gameplay trends (with consent, where required).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is used solely for operational purposes and is not repurposed for unrelated activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>We store data securely using industry-standard encryption (e.g., HTTPS, secure APIs) for server and browser interactions. Public wallet addresses and gameplay metrics are stored on secure servers or, where applicable, on the Solana blockchain (Devnet during beta).</p>
      <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Gameplay data is retained only as long as necessary for beta testing or until you request deletion. After beta testing concludes, data may be anonymized or deleted unless required for legal compliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Blockchain Transparency:</strong> Public wallet addresses and on-chain actions (e.g., $SALOONA swaps, NFT claims) are inherently visible on the Solana blockchain. This is a feature of blockchain technology and not within our control.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Personal Data and Identification</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or physical addresses. Our interactions are limited to public blockchain identifiers (e.g., Solana wallet addresses) and gameplay metrics.</p>
      <p>During beta testing on Solana Devnet, no real-world personal or financial data is collected or processed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your data to third parties. However, certain data may be publicly visible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Chain Data:</strong> Wallet addresses, $SALOONA transactions, and NFT claims are recorded on the Solana blockchain (Devnet during beta) and are publicly accessible by design.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Gameplay metrics (e.g., best draw times, win streaks) may be displayed publicly on leaderboards, linked to wallet addresses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may share anonymized data with analytics providers to improve the platform, but only with your consent where required by law (e.g., GDPR).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>DexHunt integrates with third-party services, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phantom Wallet:</strong> For Solana wallet connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Solana Blockchain:</strong> For transaction verification and reward distribution (Devnet during beta).</li>
        <li><strong>Jupiter Swap:</strong> For simulated token swaps during beta testing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These services have their own privacy policies, which you should review. We are not responsible for their data practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>We may use minimal cookies or similar technologies (e.g., local storage) to maintain session state and enhance functionality. For EU users, we obtain consent for non-essential cookies per GDPR requirements.</p>
      <p>You can manage cookie preferences via your browser settings or our consent popup (if applicable).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights under data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the data we hold about you (e.g., wallet address, gameplay metrics).</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your data, subject to technical feasibility and legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
        <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Request restricted processing of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Opt out of analytics or non-essential data processing (e.g., CCPA “Do Not Sell”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@saloona.gg">privacy@saloona.gg</a>. We will respond within 30 days (or as required by law). Note that on-chain data cannot be deleted due to blockchain immutability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>DexHunt is not intended for users under 18 years old (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a revised “Effective Date.” Continued use of the platform constitutes consent to the updated policy.</p>
