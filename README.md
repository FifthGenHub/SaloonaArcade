# 🎯 DexHunt Arcade (Beta) – Powered by $DEXHUNT

Welcome to **DexHunt**, the first reflex-based Web3 arcade shooter built entirely around skill, timing, and integrity.

> "No gambling. No luck. Just your reflexes."

DexHunt is now live in open beta. The $DEXHUNT token powers the experience as we continue to build toward skill-based tournaments, NFT collectibles, and a fully player-owned arcade ecosystem.
